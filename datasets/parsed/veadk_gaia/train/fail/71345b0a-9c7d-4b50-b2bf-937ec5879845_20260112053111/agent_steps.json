No, the user specified \"leap day\" which typically refers to February 29 in the Gregorian calendar. \n\nWait another thought: maybe the edit was made on a leap day but in a different time zone? Like, February 29 in UTC but March 1 in some local time zones? But Wikipedia uses UTC for edit timestamps, so that shouldn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the joke was removed on February 29, 2008, but the user said \"before the year 2008\". Oh, right, the user said \"before the year 2008\", so 2008 is not included. So 2004 is the only possible year.\n\nWait, let me try one last thing.
