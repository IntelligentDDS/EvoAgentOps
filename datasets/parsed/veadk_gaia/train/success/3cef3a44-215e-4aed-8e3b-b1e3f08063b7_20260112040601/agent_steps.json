First, I'll identify each item: botanical vegetables are parts of plants eaten as vegetables (roots, stems, leaves, etc.), while botanical fruits are seed-bearing structures from flowering plants. From the list: sweet potatoes (root), fresh basil (leaf), green beans (pod/legume, but botanically a fruit—wait, no, green beans are often considered vegetables in cooking but botanically fruits; wait, the user said no botanical fruits on the vegetable list. Wait, let's correct: botanical vegetables: broccoli (flower), celery (stem), zucchini (botanically a fruit, so exclude), lettuce (leaf), bell pepper (botanical fruit, exclude), corn (botanical fruit, exclude), acorns (nut, botanical fruit, exclude), peanuts (legume, botanical fruit, exclude). Wait, no, let's properly classify each:\n- milk, eggs, flour, coffee, Oreos, rice, allspice: not produce, so not part of veg/fruit here.\n- Produce items:\n  - plums: botanical fruit (include in fruit, not veg)\n  - sweet potatoes: root vegetable (botanical vegetable)\n  - fresh basil: leafy vegetable (botanical vegetable)\n  - green beans: botanically a fruit (pod with seeds), so exclude from veg\n  - corn: botanically a fruit (kernel is a seed, cob is inflorescence), exclude\n  - bell pepper: botanically a fruit (berry), exclude\n  - acorns: botanical fruit (nut), exclude\n  - broccoli: botanical vegetable (flower head)\n  - celery: botanical vegetable (stem)\n  - zucchini: botanically a fruit (berry), exclude\n  - lettuce: botanical vegetable (leaf)\n  - peanuts: botanically a fruit (legume), exclude\nNow collect the botanical vegetables: broccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes. Then alphabetize them: broccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes. Wait, alphabetical order: broccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes? Wait no, alphabetical by first word: broccoli (B), celery (C), fresh basil (F comes after C, then L (lettuce), then S (sweet potatoes). Yes. Now format as comma-separated list.\nProgress State: {\n    \"completed_list\": [\"Identified botanical vegetables from the grocery list: broccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes\", \"Alphabetized the vegetable list\"],\n    \"todo_list\": [],\n    \"experience\": [\"Botanical vegetables are parts of plants that are not seed-bearing fruiting structures; items like green beans, bell peppers, corn, zucchini are botanical fruits and excluded from the vegetable list\", \"Alphabetization is done by the first word of each item\"],\n    \"information\": [\"Final alphabetized vegetable list: broccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes\"]\n}\n\nHere is your alphabetized list of botanical vegetables (excluding all botanical fruits):\nbroccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes"
