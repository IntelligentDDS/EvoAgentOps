Fader**: In his 2018 paper *\"How to Project Customer Retention\" Revisited: The Role of Duration Dependence*, he developed a generalization of the **beta geometric (BG) model** (alongside the beta-discrete-Weibull model), building on his foundational work with the shifted-beta-geometric model for retention projection.\n\nBoth researchers leveraged the beta geometric framework for customer retention analysis during the 2018-2019 period."
