        "content": "Thought: The task is to determine the two colors of the removed edge cube by analyzing the given conditions about found cubes. First, I'll list out all cube types and their counts, then map the found cubes to identify the missing one.\n1.  Total cubes in a Rubik's cube: 1 (center) + 6 (face centers) + 12 (edges) + 8 (corners) = 27. Minus 1 removed, 26 are found.\n2.  Found cubes breakdown:\n    *   6 face centers (all are found as part of \"all blue cubes found\" and \"orange center + adjacent cubes found\" and implied completeness of centers).\n    *   6 single-color face cubes: \"All blue cubes have been found\" includes the blue face's 4 edge centers and 1 face center? Wait no, single-color cubes are the 6 face centers (each is single-color) and the 6 face cubes (the ones in the center of each face's surface, which are single-color). Wait, correction: A standard Rubik's cube has:\n        *   6 center cubes (fixed, single color)\n        *   12 edge cubes (two colors, shared between two faces)\n        *   8 corner cubes (three colors, shared between three faces)\n        *   6 face cubes (the ones in the middle of each face's \"cross\", single color, not a center cube? No, wait no, I'm mixing up. Actually, the correct count is:\n        Wait, no, let's get this right. A 3x3x3 Rubik's cube has:\n        *   1 core piece (hidden, not a colored cube)\n        *   6 center pieces (each is a single colored face, fixed relative to the core)\n        *   12 edge pieces (each has two colored faces, located on the edges between two centers)\n        *   8 corner pieces (each has three colored faces, located at the corners where three faces meet)\n        Total colored cubes: 6 + 12 + 8 = 26. Oh! Wait, that's the key mistake. The core is not colored. So total colored cubes are 26. The problem says \"one is removed\", so 25 are found? Wait no, the problem says: \"A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces.\"\n        Oh, so the problem's count is:\n        *   6 single-color cubes (these are the 6 face centers, each with one colored face)\n        *   12 edge cubes (two colored faces)\n        *   8 corner cubes (three colored faces)\n        Total: 6+12+8=26 colored cubes. One is removed, so 25 are found.\n3.  Now let's parse each condition:\n    a.  \"All blue cubes have been found.\"\n        Blue is a center color. The blue face has:\n        *   1 blue center cube (single color)\n        *   4 blue edge cubes (each has blue + another color, part of the 12 edge cubes)\n        *   4 blue corner cubes (each has blue + two other colors, part of the 8 corner cubes)\n        So all these blue-containing cubes are found: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 cubes.\n    b.  \"All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube.\"\n        Orange center cube is found (single color). The cubes directly adjacent to it are the 4 edge cubes that share a face with the orange center: these are the orange+red, orange+yellow, orange+green, orange+blue (wait no, depends on the cube's color scheme, but standard is white opposite yellow, red opposite orange, blue opposite green). Wait, standard Rubik's cube color scheme (fixed relative positions):\n        *   White opposite Yellow\n        *   Red opposite Orange\n        *   Blue opposite Green\n        *   White is adjacent to Red, Orange, Blue, Green\n        *   Yellow is adjacent to Red, Orange, Blue, Green\n        *   Red is adjacent to White, Yellow, Blue, Green\n        *   Orange is adjacent to White, Yellow, Blue, Green\n        *   Blue is adjacent to White, Yellow, Red, Orange\n        *   Green is adjacent to White, Yellow, Red, Orange\n        So the orange center's adjacent edge cubes are:\n        *   Orange + White\n        *   Orange + Yellow\n        *   Orange + Blue\n        *   Orange + Green\n        These 4 edge cubes are found, plus the orange center cube.\n        But wait, condition a already said all blue cubes are found, which includes the Orange+Blue edge cube (since it has blue), so that's redundant but confirms it's found.\n    c.  \"The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow.\"\n        Green corners are the 4 corner cubes that include green:\n        *   Green + White + Red\n        *   Green + White + Orange\n        *   Green + Yellow + Red\n        *   Green + Yellow + Orange\n        All 4 are found.\n        \"All green that borders yellow\" refers to the edge cube that is green + yellow (since that's the edge between green and yellow faces). That edge cube is found.\n    d.  \"For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.\"\n        Orange's opposite color is Red (standard scheme). So for every cube that has orange (found), the corresponding cube that has red (the opposite face's cube) is found.\n        Let's list the orange-containing cubes:\n        *   Orange center (single color) → opposite is Red center (single color), so Red center is found.\n        *   Orange edge cubes: Orange+White, Orange+Yellow, Orange+Blue, Orange+Green (all found per condition b) → their opposites are Red+Yellow, Red+White, Red+Green, Red+Blue (wait no, the opposite of Orange+White edge is Red+White edge? No, wait, the \"opposite face’s cubes\" – for an orange edge cube, which is on the orange face and another face X, the opposite face's cube would be the red face's edge cube that's on red and X. Because orange and red are opposite faces. So yes, Orange+White's opposite is Red+White, Orange+Yellow's opposite is Red+Yellow, Orange+Blue's opposite is Red+Blue, Orange+Green's opposite is Red+Green. All these red-containing edge cubes are found.\n        *   Orange corner cubes: The 4 corner cubes that include orange: Orange+White+Blue, Orange+White+Green, Orange+Yellow+Blue, Orange+Yellow+Green. Wait, but condition a says all blue cubes are found, which includes Orange+White+Blue and Orange+Yellow+Blue (since they have blue). Condition c says all green corners are found, which includes Orange+White+Green and Orange+Yellow+Green (since they have green). So all 4 orange corner cubes are found. Therefore, their opposite face's cubes (the red corner cubes) are found. The red corner cubes are Red+White+Blue, Red+White+Green, Red+Yellow+Blue, Red+Yellow+Green. All 4 are found.\n4.  Now let's list all found cubes:\n    *   Center cubes:\n        *   Blue (found, condition a)\n        *   Orange (found, condition b)\n        *   Red (found, condition d, opposite of orange center)\n        *   Green (found? Wait, condition c says all green corners are found, but does that mean green center is found? Wait condition a says all blue cubes are found (includes blue center). Condition b says orange center is found. Condition d says red center is found (opposite of orange center). What about green and white/yellow?\n        Wait, the problem says \"one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face\" – those 6 are the 6 center cubes. So one of the single-color cubes could be missing? No, wait the problem says \"the removed cube has two colors on its faces\", so it's an edge cube (since edge cubes have two colors). So all 6 single-color center cubes are found. Because the removed cube is two-colored, so not a single-color cube. So all 6 centers are found: Blue, Orange, Red, Green, White, Yellow.\n    *   Edge cubes (12 total, 1 is removed, so 11 found):\n        Let's list all 12 edge cubes:\n        1.  White+Red\n        2.  White+Orange\n        3.  White+Blue\n        4.  White+Green\n        5.  Yellow+Red\n        6.  Yellow+Orange\n        7.  Yellow+Blue\n        8.  Yellow+Green\n        9.  Red+Blue\n        10. Red+Green\n        11. Orange+Blue\n        12. Orange+Green\n        Now check which are found:\n        *   Condition b: Orange+White (2), Orange+Yellow (6), Orange+Blue (11), Orange+Green (12) → all 4 found.\n        *   Condition d: For each found orange edge cube, opposite red edge cube is found. So Orange+White (2) → Red+White (1) found; Orange+Yellow (6) → Red+Yellow (5) found; Orange+Blue (11) → Red+Blue (9) found; Orange+Green (12) → Red+Green (10) found. So 1,5,9,10 found.\n        *   Condition a: All blue cubes found. Blue edge cubes are White+Blue (3), Yellow+Blue (7), Red+Blue (9), Orange+Blue (11). 9 and 11 are already found, so 3 and 7 are also found.\n        *   Condition c: \"All green that borders yellow\" is Yellow+Green (8) → found.\n        Now let's tally found edge cubes: 2,6,11,12,1,5,9,10,3,7,8. That's 11 edge cubes. The missing one is the 12th: White+Green (4).\n        Wait let's check: 12 total, subtract 11 found, missing is White+Green? Wait no, let's list them:\n        Found edge cubes:\n        1.  White+Red (1)\n        2.  White+Orange (2)\n        3.  White+Blue (3)\n        4.  Yellow+Red (5)\n        5.  Yellow+Orange (6)\n        6.  Yellow+Blue (7)\n        7.  Yellow+Green (8)\n        8.  Red+Blue (9)\n        9.  Red+Green (10)\n        10. Orange+Blue (11)\n        11. Orange+Green (12)\n        Missing: White+Green (4). Is that correct?\n        Wait let's verify against all conditions:\n        Is White+Green edge cube not found by any condition?\n        Condition a: All blue cubes found → White+Green has no blue, so not covered.\n        Condition b: Orange center's adjacent cubes are Orange+White, Orange+Yellow, Orange+Blue, Orange+Green → White+Green not covered.\n        Condition c: All green corners found (which include White+Green+Red and White+Green+Orange, which are found), and all green that borders yellow (Yellow+Green edge, found) → White+Green edge is green that borders white, not yellow, so not covered.\n        Condition d: For all orange cubes found, opposite face's cubes are found. White+Green has no orange, so not covered.\n        Yes, that's the missing edge cube.\n    *   Corner cubes (8 total, all found? Let's check:\n        Condition a: All blue cubes found includes the 4 blue corner cubes: White+Blue+Red, White+Blue+Orange, Yellow+Blue+Red, Yellow+Blue+Orange → all found.\n        Condition c: All green corners found includes the 4 green corner cubes: White+Green+Red, White+Green+Orange, Yellow+Green+Red, Yellow+Green+Orange → all found.\n        So all 8 corner cubes are found.\n5.  The removed cube is the missing edge cube, which is White+Green. Ordered alphabetically: green, white.\nWait wait, but let's double-check if the standard color scheme is correct. Is White opposite Yellow, Red opposite Orange, Blue opposite Green? Yes, that's the standard Western Rubik's cube color scheme (with white on top, yellow on bottom, red front, orange back, blue right, green left, or some variation but opposites are fixed).\nIs there any chance the missing edge is something else? Let's check if all other edge cubes are indeed found:\n- White+Red: Found via condition d (opposite of Orange+White, which is found via condition b)\n- White+Orange: Found via condition b\n- White+Blue: Found via condition a\n- White+Green: Not found by any condition\n- Yellow+Red: Found via condition d (opposite of Orange+Yellow, found via condition b)\n- Yellow+Orange: Found via condition b\n- Yellow+Blue: Found via condition a\n- Yellow+Green: Found via condition c\n- Red+Blue: Found via condition a\n- Red+Green: Found via condition d (opposite of Orange+Green, found via condition b)\n- Orange+Blue: Found via condition a and b\n- Orange+Green: Found via condition b and c\nYes, only White+Green is missing.\nAnother way: Total edge cubes:12. Found edge cubes: let's count how many are confirmed found by conditions:\nCondition b gives 4 (Orange+White, Orange+Yellow, Orange+Blue, Orange+Green)\nCondition d gives 4 more (Red+White, Red+Yellow, Red+Blue, Red+Green) → total 8\nCondition a gives 2 more (White+Blue, Yellow+Blue) → total 10\nCondition c gives 1 more (Yellow+Green) → total 11\n12-11=1 missing: White+Green.\nYes, that's correct.\nAnd the removed cube has two colors, which are White and Green. Ordered alphabetically: green, white.\nProgress State: {\n    \"completed_list\": [\n        \"Identified standard Rubik's cube cube types and counts: 6 single-color center cubes, 12 two-color edge cubes, 8 three-color corner cubes\",\n        \"Confirmed removed cube is an edge cube (two colors)\",\n        \"Parsed all conditions to list found cubes: all 6 centers, all 8 corners, 11 edge cubes\",\n        \"Identified missing edge cube as White+Green by eliminating all found edge cubes from the total 12\"\n    ],\n    \"todo_list\": [\n        \"Order the two colors alphabetically to form the final answer\"\n    ],\n    \"experience\": [\n        \"Standard Rubik's cube color scheme opposites: White-Yellow, Red-Orange, Blue-Green\",\n        \"When conditions refer to 'opposite face’s cubes' for orange cubes, it means the corresponding cubes on the red face (opposite of orange) that share the other color(s)\"\n    ],\n    \"information\": [\n        \"Total edge cubes: 12\",\n        \"Found edge cubes: 11\",\n        \"Missing edge cube: White+Green\",\n        \"Final answer colors (alphabetical): green, white\"\n    ]\n}\n"
