        "content": "Thought: The previous step involved understanding the Tizin language rules provided, including word order (Verb-Direct Object-Subject), case forms for pronouns and nouns, and verb conjugations. The task is to translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin. First, identify the components: the verb for present tense intense like is \"Maktay\" (since it's present, root form). The direct object is \"I\" (the one being pleased, as the verb means \"is pleasing to\"), which in accusative form is \"Mato\". The subject is \"apples\", which in nominative form is \"Apple\". Arranged in V-DO-S order: \"Maktay Mato Apple\". Verify the case usage: the verb \"Maktay\" takes the experiencer (I) as the accusative object, and the thing causing pleasure (apples) as the nominative subject, which aligns with the word order rule. No further steps needed as the translation is derived directly from the provided rules.\n\nProgress State: {\n    \"completed_list\": [\"Understood Tizin word order (Verb-Direct Object-Subject)\", \"Identified present tense verb form 'Maktay' for 'is pleasing to'\", \"Determined accusative form 'Mato' for 'I' (direct object)\", \"Determined nominative form 'Apple' for 'apples' (subject)\", \"Constructed the translation: 'Maktay Mato Apple'\"],\n    \"todo_list\": [],\n    \"experience\": [],\n    \"information\": [\"Tizin basic sentence order: Verb → Direct Object → Subject\", \"Self pronouns: nominative 'Pa', accusative 'Mato', genitive 'Sing'\", \"Verb 'Maktay' (present) = 'is pleasing to'; preterit 'Tay', imperfect 'Aktay'\", \"Apple: nominative 'Apple', accusative 'Zapple', genitive 'Izapple'\"]\n}"
