Wait, no, the user said \"Tool Functions\" are available, but in the function list, only \"stop\" is shown. Wait, maybe I need to use the \"stop\" function to end, but no, the task isn't done. Wait, no, actually, maybe I made a mistake in the function calls. Let me try a different approach: search for \"Malko Competition winners Czechoslovakia\" using the correct tool. Wait, but the function list only has \"stop\". Wait, maybe the web search is a sub-agent? Wait, the user said \"Sub-Agent Functions\" are available, but they aren't listed. Wait, maybe I need to use the \"simple_web_search\" tool, but it's not in the function list here? Wait, no, looking back at the initial message, the user provided functions: the only function is \"stop\". Wait, that can't be.

But in the function definition, only \"stop\" is listed. Wait, maybe that's an error, or maybe I need to use the \"stop\" function to conclude, but I haven't gathered any information. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, let me think: maybe the web search is part of the assistant's capabilities without needing a tool call? No, the instructions say to use tool functions. Wait, maybe the function list was truncated. Wait, looking back at the system prompt:\n\nThe user provided:\n\n## Function Definition\n\n- You have access to the following functions:\n{\"name\": \"stop\", \"description\": \"\\n    Call this function to stop, signaling the iterative process should end.\\n    \", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {}}}\n\nOh, so the only available function is \"stop\". That means I can't use a web search tool. Wait, that's a problem. But the task requires searching the web for information. Wait, maybe the user expects me to answer directly? But I don't have the information. Wait, no, maybe I missed something. Wait, let me try to recall: the Malko Competition is for conductors. Let me think: did any winners from defunct countries win between 1978-1999?\n\nWait, I remember that the Malko Competition was won by Vladimir Jurowski? No, he was later. Wait, no, let me think: maybe someone from the Soviet Union? Wait, the Soviet Union existed until 1991. So winners from 1978-1991 with Soviet nationality. Wait, but who?\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe I should use the stop function and state that I need to search the web, but since the tool isn't available, I can't proceed? No, that can't be. Wait, no, maybe the user intended to include a web search function but it's missing. Wait, looking back at the example workflows: the user mentioned using \"simple_web_search\" as a tool. Oh, right, in the \"Typical Workflows\" section, they mention using \"simple_web_search\". So maybe the function is available but wasn't listed in the function definition? That must be an oversight.\n\nWait, let me try invoking \"simple_web_search\" even though it's not in the function list here. Wait, no, the system prompt says to only use the provided functions. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, the initial system prompt says:\n\n## Available Information\n- `Target Task`: The specific task to be completed.\n- `Recent Steps`: The most recent actions taken by the agent.\n- `Previous Progress State`: A JSON representation of the task's progress, including key information and milestones.\n- `Sub-Agent Functions` and `Tool Functions`: Definitions of available sub-agents and tools for task execution.\n\nBut in the Function Definition section, only \"stop\" is listed.

However, based on my knowledge, the Malko Competition winner from a defunct country (Soviet Union) in the 1978-1999 period is Vladimir Ashkenazy? No, wait, no, he's a pianist. Wait, no, the Malko Competition is for conductors. Wait, actually, I recall that Vasily Petrenko won later, but no, he's Russian (post-Soviet). Wait, no, maybe Tugan Sokhiev? No, he's from Ossetia, but that's not a defunct country. Wait, wait, let me think: the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, so any winner from 1978-1991 with Soviet nationality would qualify. Let me search my memory: did any Soviet conductors win the Malko Competition in that period? Wait, maybe Yakov Kreizberg? No, he was from Latvia, which was part of the Soviet Union, but he won later? Wait, no, Kreizberg was born in 1959, but when did he win? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe Semyon Bychkov? No, he was born in Russia, but did he win the Malko? Wait, no, I think Bychkov won other competitions. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, actually, let me check: the Malko Competition was first held in 1961. The winners include: 1978: Hannu Lintu? No, he's Finnish. 1981: Esa-Pekka Salonen? No, he's Finnish. Wait, 1984: Jukka-Pekka Saraste? Finnish. 1987: Osmo Vänskä? Finnish. 1990: Sakari Oramo? Finnish. 1993: Mikko Franck? Finnish. 1996: James Gaffigan? American. 1999: Vasily Petrenko? No, he won in 2002. Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing non-Finnish winners. Oh, right, not all winners are Finnish. Wait, 1975: Yuri Temirkanov? No, he's Soviet, but that's before 1977. 1978: maybe someone from East Germany? Wait, no, 1978 winner was Hannu Lintu (Finnish). 1981: Esa-Pekka Salonen (Finnish). 1984: Jukka-Pekka Saraste (Finnish). 1987: Osmo Vänskä (Finnish). 1990: Sakari Oramo (Finnish). 1993: Mikko Franck (Finnish). 1996: James Gaffigan (American). 1999: maybe someone from Yugoslavia? Wait, no, 1999 winner was... wait, I think 1999 was the first time a non-Finnish winner? Wait, no, maybe 1996 was James Gaffigan (American), 1999: maybe Vladimir Jurowski? No, he won in 1995? Wait, no, Jurowski was born in Moscow, Soviet Union, but did he win the Malko? Wait, no, I think he won the Karajan Competition. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, actually, let me look up (in my memory) the list of Malko winners:\n\nWait, the Malko Competition winners by year:\n1961: Jorma Panula (Finland)\n1964: Okko Kamu (Finland)\n1967: Leif Segerstam (Finland)\n1970: Eri Klas (Finland)\n1973: Jukka-Pekka Saraste (Finland) – no, wait, he won in 1984? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years.\nWait, no, correct list (from what I recall):\n- 1961: Jorma Panula\n- 1964: Okko Kamu\n- 1967: Leif Segerstam\n- 1970: Eri Klas\n- 1973: Esa-Pekka Salonen? No, he was born in 1958, so 1973 would be 15, too young.\nWait, I'm getting confused. Wait, actually, the Malko Competition was held every three years? Wait, 1961, 1964, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1976, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000? Maybe I got the years wrong. Oh! Wait, the user said \"after 1977\", so 1978 onwards. But if the competition was held every three years, the next after 1976 would be 1979. Oh! That's a mistake in my earlier planning: I assumed 1978-1999, but if the competition is triennial, the years would be 1979, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997. Oh! That's a critical error. So the target years are 1979, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997 (all 20th century, after 1977).\n\nNow, let me recall the winners of those years:\n1979: Hannu Lintu (Finland) – no, defunct country? No.\n1982: Esa-Pekka Salonen (Finland) – no.\n1985: Jukka-Pekka Saraste (Finland) – no.\n1988: Osmo Vänskä (Finland) – no.\n1991: Sakari Oramo (Finland) – no. Wait, but 1991 was the year the Soviet Union dissolved. Was there a Soviet winner in 1991? No, Oramo is Finnish.\n1994: Mikko Franck (Finland) – no.\n1997: James Gaffigan (USA) – no.\nWait, but that can't be, all Finnish or American? That can't be right. There must be non-Finnish winners. Wait, maybe I'm missing winners from other years. Wait, maybe the competition was held more frequently? Or maybe some years had non-Finnish winners. Wait, wait, maybe 1999? No, if it's triennial, 1997, 2000. Wait, maybe the competition was held in 1999? Or maybe my memory is wrong.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe a winner from Czechoslovakia? For example, did someone from Czechoslovakia win in 1980s? Wait, no, I don't recall. Wait, maybe from Yugoslavia? No. Wait, East Germany? No.\n\nWait, wait a minute: maybe I'm thinking of the wrong competition. The Malko Competition is the Malko International Competition for Young Conductors, named after Nicolai Malko, a Russian conductor. It was established in 1961 in Denmark? Wait, no, actually, it was established in Finland, by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra? Wait, no, Nicolai Malko was the principal conductor of the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Oh! Right! The Malko Competition is held by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra, not Finnish. Oh! That's my mistake! I confused it with the Finnish conducting competitions. Oh no! That's a critical error.\n\nSo the Malko Competition is based in Denmark, organized by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra. So the winners are not all Finnish. Let me correct my memory: the Malko Competition winners:\n\nWait, let me recall:\n1961: Jorma Panula (Finland) – still Finnish, but maybe later years have international winners.\n1964: Okko Kamu (Finland)\n1967: Leif Segerstam (Finland)\n1970: Eri Klas (Finland)\n1973: Yuri Temirkanov (Soviet Union) – yes! 1973, but that's before 1977, so not in target period.\n1976: Esa-Pekka Salonen (Finland) – before 1977.\n1979: Hannu Lintu (Finland) – target period, but Finnish.\n1982: Yakov Kreizberg (Soviet Union, Latvia) – yes! 1982, which is after 1977. Yakov Kreizberg was born in Riga, which was part of the Soviet Union (a defunct country). Wait, but was he a Soviet national when he won? Yes, in 1982, Latvia was part of the Soviet Union, so his nationality would be Soviet Union, which no longer exists. But wait, is he the only one?\nWait, 1985: Semyon Bychkov (Soviet Union, Russia) – yes, 1985, Soviet national. Oh, so there are two? But the user says \"the only Malko Competition recipient from the 20th Century (after 1977) whose nationality on record is a country that no longer exists\". So maybe I'm wrong. Wait, no, maybe Kreizberg was already an Israeli citizen by 1982? No, he left the Soviet Union in 1976, moved to Israel, so maybe his nationality was Israeli when he won in 1982? Oh! That's a key point. So his nationality at the time of winning would be Israeli, not Soviet. Oh! So that changes things.\n\nWait, Semyon Bychkov: he was born in Leningrad, Soviet Union, in 1952. He left the Soviet Union in 1974, moved to the US? No, wait, Bychkov moved to the US in 1975. So when he won the Malko Competition in 1985, his nationality would be American, not Soviet? Or was he still Soviet? No, he defected, so his nationality would have changed.\n\nWait, who else? 1988: Osmo Vänskä (Finland) – no. 1991: Sakari Oramo (Finland) – no. 1994: Vladimir Jurowski (Russia) – wait, 1994, after the Soviet Union dissolved (1991), so his nationality would be Russian, not Soviet. So Russia still exists. 1997: James Gaffigan (USA) – no. 2000: Vasily Petrenko (Russia) – no.\n\nWait, what about 1990? Wait, maybe the competition was held in 1990 instead of 1991? Or maybe I'm missing a year. Wait, let me check: the Malko Competition was held every three years from 1961 to 1997, then in 2000, 2003, etc. So 1961, 1964, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1976, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997.\n\nWait, is there a winner from East Germany? For example, in 1980s? No, I don't recall. What about Yugoslavia? No. Czechoslovakia? No.\n\nWait, wait, maybe 1979: was there a co-winner? No, the competition has one first prize. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about Yakov Kreizberg's nationality. Let me check: Yakov Kreizberg was born in Riga, Latvia, USSR, in 1953. He emigrated to Israel in 1976, became an Israeli citizen, then moved to the US. He won the Malko Competition in 1982. So his nationality at the time of winning would be Israeli, not Soviet, so Israel still exists, so that doesn't count.\n\nWait, what about Semyon Bychkov: he won the Malko Competition in 1985. He was born in Leningrad, USSR, but he defected to the US in 1975, so he was an American citizen by 1985? Or was he still a Soviet citizen? No, defectors lose their Soviet citizenship. So his nationality would be American, which still exists.\n\nWait, is there any other winner from a defunct country? What about 1991: was the winner from the Soviet Union? No, 1991 winner was Sakari Oramo, Finnish. The Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991, so if the competition was held before December, the winner could be Soviet, but Oramo is Finnish.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a winner from Czechoslovakia. For example, did someone from Czechoslovakia win in 1980s? I don't recall. What about Poland? No, Poland still exists. Hungary? No. Romania? No.\n\nWait, wait a minute: maybe the competition was held in 1978? No, according to the triennial schedule, 1976, 1979. So 1978 is not a competition year.\n\nWait, maybe the user's \"after 1977\" includes 1978, but if the competition wasn't held in 1978, there are no winners that year. So the first possible year is 1979.\n\nWait, is there any winner from a defunct country in 1979-1999? Let me think again: maybe a winner from Yugoslavia? For example, in 1990s? But Yugoslavia dissolved in 1991, so winners after 1991 would be from Croatia, Serbia, etc., which still exist (or some are defunct, like Yugoslavia, but if they won after 1991, their nationality would be Croatian, etc., not Yugoslavian). If someone won in 1988 or earlier from Yugoslavia, that would count. But I don't recall any Yugoslavian winners.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong about the list of winners. Let me try to find the correct list in my memory:\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check (using my knowledge) the official winners list:\n\nWait, according to the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra's records, the Malko Competition winners are:\n\n1961: Jorma Panula (Finland)\n1964: Okko Kamu (Finland)\n1967: Leif Segerstam (Finland)\n1970: Eri Klas (Finland)\n1973: Yuri Temirkanov (USSR) – before 1977\n1976: Esa-Pekka Salonen (Finland) – before 1977\n1979: Hannu Lintu (Finland)\n1982: Yakov Kreizberg (Israel) – nationality Israel, not defunct\n1985: Semyon Bychkov (USA) – nationality USA, not defunct\n1988: Osmo Vänskä (Finland)\n1991: Sakari Oramo (Finland)\n1994: Vladimir Jurowski (Russia) – Russia exists\n1997: James Gaffigan (USA)\n2000: Vasily Petrenko (Russia)\n2003: Andris Nelsons (Latvia) – Latvia exists (was part of USSR, but now independent)\n2006: Joshua Weilerstein (USA)\n2009: Michael Francis (UK)\n2012: Elim Chan (Hong Kong)\n2015: Ryan Bancroft (USA)\n2018: Jonathon Heyward (USA)\n2021: Klaus Mäkelä (Finland)\n\nWait, so in the target period (1978-1999), the winners are:\n1979: Hannu Lintu (Finland)\n1982: Yakov Kreizberg (Israel)\n1985: Semyon Bychkov (USA)\n1988: Osmo Vänskä (Finland)\n1991: Sakari Oramo (Finland)\n1994: Vladimir Jurowski (Russia)\n1997: James Gaffigan (USA)\n\nNone of these have nationalities that are defunct countries, except maybe Yakov Kreizberg was originally from the USSR, but his nationality when winning was Israel. Semyon Bychkov was originally from USSR, but his nationality when winning was USA. Vladimir Jurowski was born in USSR, but when he won in 1994, the USSR had dissolved, so his nationality was Russia, which still exists.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the user's statement that there is \"the only Malko Competition recipient from the 20th Century (after 1977) whose nationality on record is a country that no longer exists\". So maybe my memory is wrong. Maybe one of these winners had their nationality listed as Soviet Union, not their current nationality. For example, Yakov Kreizberg: maybe the competition records his nationality as USSR, even though he was an Israeli citizen? Or Semyon Bychkov: listed as USSR in 1985?\n\nWait, no, competition records usually list"
