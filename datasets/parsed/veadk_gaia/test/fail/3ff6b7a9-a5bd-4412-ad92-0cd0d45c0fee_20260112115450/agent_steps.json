First, I need to identify the longest-lived vertebrate and the island it's named after. Then, I'll search Wikipedia for that island's 2020 population estimate.\n\n1.  **Identify the longest-lived vertebrate and its eponymous island:** The longest-lived vertebrate is the Greenland shark, but it's not named after an island. Another candidate is the bowhead whale, but again, not island-named. The Galápagos tortoise is long-lived, named after the Galápagos Islands. However, recent studies suggest the Greenland shark can live over 400 years, longer than the Galápagos tortoise. Wait, but is it named after an island? Greenland is an island. Yes, the Greenland shark is named after Greenland, which is an island. Let me confirm this is indeed the longest-lived vertebrate according to Wikipedia as of 2021.\n2.  **Verify the longest-lived vertebrate:** A quick search is needed to confirm the longest-lived vertebrate and its namesake island as of early 2021.\n3.  **Find the island's 2020 population estimate:** Once the island is confirmed (likely Greenland), search Wikipedia for its page and locate the 2020 estimated population, rounding to the nearest thousand.\n\nI will start by using the `simple_web_search` tool to confirm the longest-lived vertebrate named after an island.\n"
