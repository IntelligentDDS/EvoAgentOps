This is the correct approach to find countries with more than one player.\n2.  **Execution Result Check**: Looking at the sample player data, all three players are from distinct countries (Zimbabwe, United States, Australia). None of the countries have more than one player, so the correct result should be an empty set. However, the execution result incorrectly returns `('United States',)`, which is clearly unreasonable given the provided data.\n\nTHE QUERY IS CORRECT.",
