Since `order_item_id` is the primary key of `Order_Items`, it cannot be NULL, so `COUNT(oi.order_item_id)` is equivalent to `COUNT(*)` here and will accurately count items.\n4.  **No Common Mistakes**:\n    - No `NOT IN` with NULLs\n    - No inappropriate `UNION` (no union at all)\n    - No `BETWEEN` for exclusive ranges\n    - No data type mismatches in predicates\n    - Identifiers are properly handled (no reserved words used as identifiers here)\n    - Functions are used with correct argument counts\n    - No unnecessary casting needed\n    - Join columns are correct\n    - No explicit execution failures\n    - The result set is reasonable (it returns order IDs and their dates as requested)\n\nTHE QUERY IS CORRECT.",
