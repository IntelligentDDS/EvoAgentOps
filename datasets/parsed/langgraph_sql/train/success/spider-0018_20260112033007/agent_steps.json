The data type of `Wins_count` is INTEGER, so the comparison with the integer 2 is valid (no data type mismatch).\n3.  **DISTINCT Usage**: `SELECT DISTINCT c.Name` is appropriate here to avoid duplicate club names if multiple players from the same club meet the criteria.\n4.  **Execution Result Validation**: Looking at the sample data:\n    - Arsenal (Club_ID 1) has Nick Price with 4 wins (meets >2)\n    - Blackburn Rovers (Club_ID 3) has Paul Azinger with 3 wins (meets >2)\n    - Greg Norman is in Club_ID 5, which does not exist in the `club` table, so he is excluded by the join.\n    The execution result correctly returns the two clubs that qualify.\n\nNo mistakes from the listed categories are present.\n\nTHE QUERY IS CORRECT.",
