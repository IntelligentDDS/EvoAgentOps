Then divide the total length by the length of each small piece: 48 ÷ 6 = 8.\nThe answer is {{8}}.\nUsing the solutions from other agents as additional information, can you provide your answer to the math problem? The original math problem is Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?.
