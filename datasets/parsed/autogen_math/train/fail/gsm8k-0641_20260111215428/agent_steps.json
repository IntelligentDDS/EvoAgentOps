Total annual earnings: $252,000 + $10,000 = $262,000.\n\nThe answer is {{262000}}.\nOne agent solution: First, compute the new monthly salary: 5% of $20,000 is $1,000, so new monthly pay is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.\nAnnual salary from monthly pay: $21,000 × 12 = $252,000.\nBonus (half the original monthly salary): $20,000 ÷ 2 = $10,000.\nTotal annual earnings: $252,000 + $10,000 = $262,000.\n\nThe answer is {{262000}}.\nUsing the solutions from other agents as additional information, can you provide your answer to the math problem? The original math problem is Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form of {answer}, at the end of your response."
