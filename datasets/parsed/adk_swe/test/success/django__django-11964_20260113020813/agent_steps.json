      "output": "I see the issue now. The `DeferredAttribute` descriptor in lines 114-139 just gets and sets the value directly in the instance's `__dict__`. It doesn't use any conversion when setting the value - only when getting it from the database.\n\nLet me check how the field value is set when you assign it on an instance. Looking at the Field class, I notice there's a `__set__` method? Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\nActually, looking at `contribute_to_class` method in the Field class (line 749-768), it sets the descriptor:\n```python\nif self.column:\n    # Don't override classmethods with the descriptor. This means that\n    # if you have a classmethod and a field with the same name, then\n    # such fields can't be deferred (we don't have a check for this).\n    if not getattr(cls, self.attname, None):\n        setattr(cls, self.attname, self.descriptor_class(self))\n```\n\nThe descriptor class is `DeferredAttribute` by default, which we just saw doesn't handle setting values at all. Wait, that's strange - how does assignment work? Oh, wait, DeferredAttribute only implements __get__, not __set__. So when you do `obj.field = value`, it just sets it directly on the instance's __dict__ without any conversion!\n\nThat explains the issue! When you assign an enum instance to the field, it just stores the enum instance directly, it doesn't convert it to the underlying value (str or int). But when you retrieve from the database, it goes through the field's conversion methods.\n\nLet me verify this understanding. Let me check if there's some other mechanism that handles setting field values.\n\n",

      "output": "Okay, so regular fields don't have a `__set__` method - only special fields like relations and files do. That confirms my understanding! When you set a field value on a model instance directly, it just stores it raw in the instance's dictionary without any conversion.\n\nThe fix should be to ensure that when we assign an enum value (that's an instance of TextChoices or IntegerChoices) to a field, it gets converted to its underlying value. There are a few approaches:\n\n1. Add a __set__ method to the base Field class or DeferredAttribute descriptor that converts values\n2. Make the to_python method handle enum instances\n3. Add a pre_save hook that converts values\n\nLooking at the architecture, option 2 seems the cleanest. The `to_python` method is responsible for converting values to the proper Python type for the field. Let me check how this is currently handled.\n\n",

      "output": "Ah, okay. Looking at this behavior, I can see that in older Python versions (like 3.6), when you inherit from str and Enum, the __str__ method from Enum takes precedence. But actually, let me check what Django expects here.\n\nWait the real issue described in the PR is that:\n1. When you create an instance and set `my_str_value=MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE`, the `my_object.my_str_value` returns the enum instance\n2. But when you retrieve the object from the database, `my_object.my_str_value` returns just the string \"first\"\n\nSo there's an inconsistency between newly created objects (that have the enum instance) and retrieved objects (that have the pure string/int).\n\nLet me check how values are converted when loading from the database vs when set directly.\n\nThe fix should ensure consistency - whether you set an enum instance or a raw value, the field should always return the same type - either always the enum instance or always the raw type. But according to the test, the expected behavior is that it returns the raw type (str or int).\n\nActually looking more carefully at the test:\n```python\ndef test_created_object_is_str(self):\n    my_object = self.my_object\n    self.assertIsInstance(my_object.my_str_value, str)\n    self.assertEqual(str(my_object.my_str_value), \"first\")\n```\n\nSo the test expects that `my_object.my_str_value` is actually a str, not a MyChoice instance that inherits from str.\n\nActually wait, let me check what happens when you retrieve from the database. Let me set up a full test.\n\n",

      "output": "Perfect! Now I see the issue clearly:\n1. When you set an enum value on a field and haven't saved it to the database yet, the field contains the actual enum instance (which inherits from str/int)\n2. When you retrieve the object from the database, the field contains just the plain str/int value, not an enum instance\n3. `str()` of the enum instance returns the enum name representation, not the actual value string\n\nSo the behavior is inconsistent. The real issue is that Django should be normalizing the value to the plain type, not keeping the enum instance, or at least ensuring consistent behavior.\n\nActually, wait, let me think about this more carefully. What's the expected behavior here?\n\nLooking at other parts of Django, when you use choices, typically you can set either the raw value or the display value? No, actually, when you use choices tuples, you can set either the actual value or... no, actually you can only set the actual value. Wait, no actually - when you use choices, you can set either the value OR any object that can be converted to it via to_python.\n\nWait actually, looking at the problem more, I think the issue is that:\n1. When you assign an enum instance to the field, it's storing it as-is\n2. But when you load from the database, it's just creating a plain str/int from the DB value\n\nSo the fix should be to convert the enum instance to its underlying plain value when assigning it to the field.\n\nWhere should this happen? The cleanest place would be in the field's to_python method, since that's what's responsible for converting values to the proper Python type. But wait, to_python is actually already being called?\n\nWait let me check when to_python gets called. Actually, looking at the code:\n- When you create an object via Model.objects.create(), it calls get_db_prep_save which calls get_prep_value\n- For CharField, get_prep_value calls to_python\n- But wait, let me check if to_python actually gets called when setting the value directly on the instance... It doesn't! Only when saving to the DB or when loading from the DB.\n\nActually, this is the real problem. When you set the value directly on an instance, it doesn't go through any conversion. The conversion only happens when saving to/loading from the database.\n\nBut wait, actually, for regular Python usage, when you set `obj.field = value`, Django doesn't convert it immediately. It only converts it when saving.\n\nHowever, the test is expecting that immediately after setting or creating, the value should already be converted to the proper type (plain str/int).\n\nWait let me check what happens in get_prep_value for these fields:\n\n",

      "output": "Okay, now I understand the issue completely. The problem is:\n1. When you set an enum value on a model field, it stores the enum instance directly (which is a subclass of str/int)\n2. When you save to the database, it correctly stores just the underlying value (since get_prep_value converts it properly)\n3. When you retrieve from the database, you get a plain str/int\n4. The enum instance has an overridden __str__ method that returns the enum name representation, not the actual value string\n5. So when you call str() on a newly created object's field, you get the enum name, but when you call it on a retrieved object's field, you get the actual value string\n\nThe test expects consistent behavior where both the newly created and retrieved objects have the same type and str() representation.\n\nSo what's the right fix? We have a few options:\n\n1. Fix the __str__ method of TextChoices/IntegerChoices to return the value instead of the enum name\n2. Make the field convert the enum instance to a plain str/int when setting it\n3. Make the descriptor (DeferredAttribute) convert values when setting them\n\nActually, looking at option 1, wait - why does the enum have its own __str__ method that returns the enum name? Let me check what the enum module does.\n\nActually, in Python's enum.Enum, the __str__ method returns the repr-like string. But when you subclass from enum.Enum and another type like str, the other type's __str__ should be used? Or does Enum override it?\n\nWait let me check what's happening. Actually, let me look at what TextChoices does:\n\n",

The real issue is that we have inconsistent types depending on whether the object was just created or retrieved from the database. When retrieved from DB, we get a plain str/int, not an enum instance.\n\nActually, that makes sense because when you retrieve from the DB, Django just gets the raw value and converts it to Python type, but doesn't try to convert it back to an enum instance.\n\nWait actually, this might be the real issue. Should Django convert DB values back to enum instances when choices are defined as an Enum class?\n\nActually, no - looking at the current behavior, Django doesn't automatically convert DB values back to enum instances even when you use enum choices. That's consistent with how choices work - choices are just for validation and display, not for automatically casting values to enum instances.\n\nWait let me confirm this with a test.

When retrieved from DB, it's the plain value, so when creating, it should also return the plain value, or the enum instance should behave like the plain value when str() is called.\n\nActually, let me check what other people expect. Let me look for existing issues or similar code.\n\nActually, wait - let's think about this from the Python data model perspective. If a class inherits from str, should it not behave like a str in every way? The fact that str(MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE) returns something that isn't the string value seems wrong.\n\nActually, looking at Python's Enum documentation, if you create an enum that inherits from another type, it's supposed to behave like that type. Wait actually, let me check Python's enum:\n\n",

The user wants that when they set an enum value on a model field, they get back the same type as they would if they retrieve it from the database - a plain str/int, not an enum instance.\n\nWait actually, no - looking at the test, the test is expecting `str(my_object.my_str_value)` to return \"first\", which is what happens with the plain str from the database. So actually, either:\n1. We need to fix the enum instance to have __str__ return the value, OR\n2. We need to convert enum instances to plain str/int when setting them on fields\n\nI think option 1 is better because it fixes the enum to behave properly like a string. Wait but actually, this is Python's native enum behavior. Let me check if this was fixed in later Python versions.\n\nWait actually, looking at the issue, let me check Django's code. Wait Django's TextChoices could override __str__ to return the value. That would make sense!\n\nActually, let me implement that fix.

      "output": "Oh wait, JSON actually already serializes it correctly! That's because json.dumps checks for isinstance(obj, str) which returns True, and then it uses its str serialization which internally probably calls obj.__str__() now that we've fixed it? Wait no, actually - let me check what json.dumps actually does:\n\nJSON encoder looks for str instances and then serializes them using their __str__ method? Wait actually looking at Python's JSON encoder code, it will use PyUnicode_AsUTF8String which gets the string buffer directly, not by calling str().\n\nBut actually, regardless of all that, our fix ensures that str(obj) returns the actual value, which is what the user was expecting in their test and in API responses.\n\n## Summary of the fix:\n\nThe issue was that when using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`:\n1. When you set an enum instance on a model field and access it immediately (before saving to DB or after setting directly on an instance), calling `str()` on it returned the enum name representation (e.g. \"MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE\")\n2. But when you retrieved the same object from the database, calling `str()` on it returned the actual value (e.g. \"first\")\n\nThis inconsistency could lead to unexpected issues when communicating with external APIs or serializing data.\n\nI fixed this by:\n1. Overriding the `__str__` method on `TextChoices` class to return the underlying string value\n2. Overriding the `__str__` method on `IntegerChoices` class to return the underlying integer value as string\n\nThe fix uses `super().__str__()` which properly delegates to the parent type (str or int) string conversion, ensuring that the actual value is returned instead of the enum name representation.\n\nThis makes the behavior consistent regardless of whether you're accessing the field on a freshly created instance or one retrieved from the database. In both cases, `str(field_value)` now returns the actual value string (e.g. \"first\" or \"1\").\n\nThe fix is minimal and focused on just the problematic classes, without affecting other Choices usage or any existing behavior beyond string conversion.\n\n",

      "output": "Perfect! I've successfully implemented the fix for the issue described in the PR. Here's what I did:\n\n## Summary of Changes:\n\n1. **Modified `/testbed/django/db/models/enums.py`** to fix inconsistent string representation when using `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`:\n   - Added `__str__()` method to `IntegerChoices` that returns the integer value as a string (using `super().__str__()`)\n   - Added `__str__()` method to `TextChoices` that returns the actual string value (using `super().__str__()`)\n\n## Why this fix works:\n\nThe problem was that `enum.Enum` overrides the `__str__()` method to return the enum name representation (like \"MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE\") instead of the actual underlying value. Even though `TextChoices` inherits from `str` and `IntegerChoices` inherits from `int`, the Enum-provided `__str__()` was being used instead of the primitive type's implementation.\n\nBy explicitly overriding `__str__()` in both classes to call the parent class's implementation, we ensure that:\n- `str(MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE)` now returns `\"first\"` (the actual value) instead of `\"MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE\"`\n- `str(MyIntChoice.FIRST)` now returns `\"1\"` instead of `\"MyIntChoice.FIRST\"`\n\n## Results:\n\n- All tests from the PR description now pass successfully\n- The behavior is consistent whether you access the field immediately after setting it or retrieve it from the database\n- `str()` on the field value now returns the expected value string in all cases\n- All existing functionality and tests remain intact (choices generation, labels, values, etc.)\n- Edge cases like empty string values, zero values, etc. work correctly\n\nThe fix is minimal, focused, and resolves the exact issue described in the PR without introducing any regression or unexpected behavior.",
