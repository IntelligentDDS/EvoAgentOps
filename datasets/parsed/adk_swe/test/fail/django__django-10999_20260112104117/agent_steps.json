Many negative durations like `1:-2:3`, `1:2:-3`, `-1:-2:-3`, etc. are returning None - they're not matching the regex at all.\n\nLooking more carefully at line 32, the issue is that when we have something like \"-1:00:00\", the regex is matching the \"-1\" as days instead of hours because the days pattern comes first. But actually the bigger issue is the lookahead pattern `(?=\\d+:\\d+)` that doesn't allow for negative signs in the minutes/seconds parts.\n\nLet me fix the regex as specified in the PR description:\n\n",

There's another issue: when we have \"-1:02:03\", the regex is matching \"-1\" as days instead of as hours because the days pattern comes first in the regex.\n\nWait that's a separate issue from what was reported in the PR.

Looking at the test file on line 117:\n```python\n('-1:15:30', timedelta(hours=-1, minutes=15, seconds=30)),\n```\n\nSo the expected behavior is that when you have \"-1:15:30\", it's parsed as hours=-1, minutes=15, seconds=30, not -(1 hour 15 minutes 30 seconds). My test expectations were wrong!\n\nActually, wait, let me re-read the issue. The issue says \"the lookahead part does not have '-?' in it\" and that this doesn't match negative durations. Looking at the failing tests that are now fixed:\n- `1:-2:3` now matches ✓ (was None before)\n- `1:2:-3` now matches ✓ (was None before)\n- `-1:-2:-3` now matches ✓ (was None before)\n- `0:0:-1.123456` now matches ✓ (was None before)\n\nThe PR fix has worked! Those negative values in minutes and seconds positions are now matching correctly.\n\nLet me run the actual Django tests to make sure we didn't break anything:\n\n",

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nFix parse_duration() for some negative durations\nDescription\n\t\nThe ​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/_modules/django/utils/dateparse/ defines:\nstandard_duration_re = re.compile(\n\tr'^'\n\tr'(?:(?P<days>-?\\d+) (days?, )?)?'\n\tr'((?:(?P<hours>-?\\d+):)(?=\\d+:\\d+))?'\n\tr'(?:(?P<minutes>-?\\d+):)?'\n\tr'(?P<seconds>-?\\d+)'\n\tr'(?:\\.(?P<microseconds>\\d{1,6})\\d{0,6})?'\n\tr'$'\n)\nthat doesn't match to negative durations, because of the <hours> definition final (lookahead) part does not have '-?' in it. The following will work:\n\tr'((?:(?P<hours>-?\\d+):)(?=-?\\d+:-?\\d+))?'\n(Thanks to Konstantin Senichev for finding the fix.)\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "Perfect! I have successfully implemented the fix for the parse_duration() function as described in the PR. Here's what was done:\n\n## Summary of Changes:\n\n1. **Modified `/testbed/django/utils/dateparse.py`**:\n   - Changed the lookahead pattern in `standard_duration_re` on line 32\n   - **Before**: `(?=\\d+:\\d+)` - This only matched positive digits followed by colon and more positive digits\n   - **After**: `(?=-?\\d+:-?\\d+)` - This now allows optional minus signs before digits in both positions\n\n## The Problem:\nThe original regex pattern would not match durations where minutes or seconds parts were negative, such as:\n- `\"1:-2:3\"` (1 hour, -2 minutes, 3 seconds)\n- `\"1:2:-3\"` (1 hour, 2 minutes, -3 seconds)\n- `\"0:0:-1.123456\"` (-1.123456 seconds)\n- `\" -1:-2:-3\"` (-1 hour, -2 minutes, -3 seconds)\n\nThese would return `None` (not match at all) when passed to `parse_duration()`.\n\n## The Solution:\nAdding `-?` inside the lookahead pattern allows the regex to match when the following numbers (minutes and seconds) might be negative.\n\n## Testing:\n✅ All the previously problematic negative durations now work correctly  \n✅ All existing positive durations continue to work as before  \n✅ Mixed sign durations (e.g., positive hours with negative minutes) now work\n✅ The fix is minimal and exactly addresses the issue described in the PR without breaking existing functionality\n\nThe implementation is complete and ready. The specific bug mentioned in the PR description has been fixed.",
