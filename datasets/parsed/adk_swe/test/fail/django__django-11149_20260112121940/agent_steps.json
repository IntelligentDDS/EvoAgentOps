As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "## Summary\n\nI've successfully fixed the issue described in the PR. The problem was that **Admin inlines for auto-created ManyToManyFields were editable if the user only had the view permission**.\n\n### The Problem\nThe `InlineModelAdmin` methods `has_add_permission()`, `has_change_permission()`, and `has_delete_permission()` were returning `True` for any user that had view permission on either the parent model or the related model. This meant users with only view access could add/remove items from M2M relationships.\n\n### The Fix\nI modified these methods in `/testbed/django/contrib/admin/options.py` (lines 2114-2145) to properly check for **change permission on the parent model** instead of view permission, since modifying relationships requires the ability to change the parent model.\n\n#### Changes made:\n1. **For auto-created intermediate models (M2M through tables):**\n   - `has_add_permission()`: Checks if user has `change` permission on the parent model instead of `view` permission\n   - `has_change_permission()`: Same fix\n   - `has_delete_permission()`: Same fix\n   - Added safety check for when `request` is `None` (e.g., command-line usage) to return `True`\n   - Also fixed `has_view_permission()` to handle `request = None` case\n\n2. **Why this works:**\n   - **View-only users:** Will have `has_view_permission()` return `True` (so they can see the inline) but `has_add/change/delete_permission()` return `False` (so the inline is rendered read-only with no add/delete buttons)\n   - **Users with change permission:** Will have all permissions return `True`, so they can fully edit the M2M relationship\n   - **Command-line/admin scripts:** Will work as before when no request object is available\n\nThe fix is minimal, focused, and maintains backward compatibility for users who actually have change permission while properly restricting view-only users from making changes.",
