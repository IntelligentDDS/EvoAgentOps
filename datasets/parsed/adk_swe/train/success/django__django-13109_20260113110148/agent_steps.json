I can see that in ModelChoiceField's `to_python` method (line 1272-1282), it uses `self.queryset.get(...)` which will be the queryset we set on the form field (which in the PR example uses the base manager). So form-level validation actually works fine. The issue described in the PR is specifically about model-level validation (the `validate` method on the ForeignKey field itself) which was still using `_default_manager`.\n\nOur fix addresses exactly the issue described.

      "output": "Perfect! The fix is working exactly as described in the PR. \n\nTo summarize what we've done:\n1. **Identified the problem**: In the ForeignKey.validate() method, Django was using `_default_manager` to check if a related object exists. This means that if the default manager filters out certain objects (like archived articles in the PR example), validation would fail even though the object exists in the database.\n\n2. **Made the fix**: Changed one line in `/testbed/django/db/models/fields/related.py`:\n   - Changed line 917 from: `qs = self.remote_field.model._default_manager.using(using).filter(`\n   - Changed to: `qs = self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(`\n\n3. **Tested thoroughly**:\n   - ✅ The original issue is fixed - forms can now validate objects that exist in the database but are filtered by the default manager\n   - ✅ limit_choices_to still works correctly\n   - ✅ Custom primary keys work properly\n   - ✅ ForeignKeys pointing to fields other than primary key (using to_field) work correctly\n   - ✅ Both form validation and model validation (full_clean) work properly\n   - ✅ Normal objects (not filtered by default manager) still validate correctly\n\nThe fix is minimal, focused, and solves exactly the problem described in the PR. Using `_base_manager` is the right approach here because:\n- It provides access to all objects in the database, regardless of what filters are applied by the default manager\n- It still honors database routing\n- It properly applies limit_choices_to filters\n- It doesn't break any existing functionality\n\nThis change ensures that when a user selects an object in a form (even if that object is filtered out by the default manager), the validation will pass as long as the object exists in the database, which is the expected behavior when the form itself provides access to those objects via the base manager.\n\n",

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nForeignKey.validate() should validate using the base manager.\nDescription\n\t\nForeignKey.validate() should validate using the base manager instead of the default manager.\nConsider the models:\nclass ArticleManager(models.Manage):\n\tdef get_queryset(self):\n\t\tqs = super().get_queryset()\n\t\treturn qs.filter(archived=False)\nclass Article(models.Model):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\tarchived = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n\t# Don't include archived articles by default.\n\tobjects = ArticleManager()\nclass FavoriteAricles(models.Model):\n\tarticle = models.ForeignKey(Article, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIn the example, now consider a form that allows users to pick a favorite article including archived articles.\nclass FavoriteAriclesForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = FavoriteArticle\n\t\tfields = '__all__'\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\t# Use the base manager instead of the default manager to allow archived articles.\n\t\tself.fields['article'].queryset = Article._base_manager.all()\nThe above form will never validate as True when a user selects an archived article. This is because the ForeignKey validation always uses _default_manager instead of _base_manager. The user facing error message is \"article instance with id 123 does not exist.\" (quite confusing to typical users). The code for this validation is here:\n​https://github.com/django/django/blob/94f63b926fd32d7a7b6e2591ef72aa8f040f25cc/django/db/models/fields/related.py#L917-L919\nThe FavoriteAriclesForm is specifically designed to use a different manager, but the ForeignKey validation makes this difficult.\nIn this example scenario, it is not acceptable to change the model's default manager as the default should avoid archived articles in other typical scenarios.\nSuggested solution: the ForeignKey validation should use the _base_manager instead which does not include the default filters.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.
