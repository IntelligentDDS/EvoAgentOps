Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nSimplify signature of `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush()`\nDescription\n\t\nThe current signature is:\ndef execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):\nThe using argument can be dropped and inferred by the calling instance: self.connection.alias.\ndef execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):\nSome internal ises of this method are already doing:\nconnection.ops.execute_sql_flush(connection.alias, sql_flush)\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nSimplify signature of `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush()`\nDescription\n\t\nThe current signature is:\ndef execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):\nThe using argument can be dropped and inferred by the calling instance: self.connection.alias.\ndef execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):\nSome internal ises of this method are already doing:\nconnection.ops.execute_sql_flush(connection.alias, sql_flush)\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\".

      "output": "The requested changes have been successfully implemented:\n\n## Summary of Changes:\n\n1. **Updated the method signature in `/testbed/django/db/backends/base/operations.py`**\n   - Changed `def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):` \n   - To: `def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):`\n   - Updated the implementation to use `self.connection.alias` instead of the passed `using` parameter:\n     ```python\n     with transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias, ...):\n     ```\n\n2. **Updated the call site in `/testbed/django/core/management/commands/flush.py`**\n   - Changed line 63 from:\n     ```python\n     connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(database, sql_list)\n     ```\n   - To:\n     ```python\n     connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(sql_list)\n     ```\n\n## Verification:\n\n✅ The method now has the simplified signature requested: `execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list)`\n✅ All call sites within the Django codebase have been updated to match the new signature\n✅ The implementation still correctly gets the database alias from `self.connection.alias` (instead of relying on being passed the alias)\n✅ Calling the method with the old signature would now raise a `TypeError`, ensuring that old usage patterns are properly cleaned up\n✅ No database backend implementations override this method (verified by checking mysql, postgresql, sqlite3 backends), so no further updates are needed\n\nThe changes are minimal, focused, and follow the recommendations in the PR description perfectly. The database alias is correctly inferred from the calling instance's connection object rather than being passed unnecessarily.",
