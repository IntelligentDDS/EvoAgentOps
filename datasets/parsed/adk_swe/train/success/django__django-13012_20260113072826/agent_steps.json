For ExpressionWrapper, this would call the base Expression method which returns empty list. But wait, maybe there's more to this. Let me check what happens when it compiles the expression for the SELECT clause and then tries to get group by cols. Wait, maybe the issue is that ExpressionWrapper itself isn't recognized as something that wraps a constant - so when the code processes the select clause, it might be handling ExpressionWrapper differently?\n\nLet me first create a reproduction script to verify the issue.\n\n",

Wait no, in the code it says `expr.get_group_by_cols()`.\n\nWait wait, maybe I misunderstood - actually, maybe the issue is NOT with get_group_by_cols(), but rather with something else. Wait, let me look again at get_group_by function:\n\nAt line 109-113, it adds expressions from query.group_by. Where does query.group_by get set?\n\nWait the issue mentions that this happens with `.values('expr_res', 'column_a')`. The .values() method likely sets query.group_by.

So now I understand the bug:\n\n1. **BaseExpression.get_group_by_cols()** returns `[self]` if the expression doesn't contain an aggregate (line 350-356)\n2. **Value.get_group_by_cols()** overrides this to return `[]` (empty list), which is correct because constants don't need to be in GROUP BY\n3. **ExpressionWrapper.get_group_by_cols()** DOES NOT override this method, so it inherits the behavior from BaseExpression which returns `[self]` when there's no aggregate expression inside it\n\nThe fix is simple: we need to add a `get_group_by_cols` method to ExpressionWrapper that delegates to the wrapped expression's `get_group_by_cols` method.\n\nLet me implement this fix:\n\n",
