All the requirements from the PR are now satisfied:\n\n## Summary of Changes:\n\n### 1. **Fixed the `Columns` class in `/testbed/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`** (lines 84-94):\n- Changed from just appending the suffix directly: \n  ```python\n  return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]\n  ```\n- To checking if the suffix is not empty and adding a space before it:\n  ```python\n  suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n  if suffix:\n      return f\"{self.quote_name(column)} {suffix}\"\n  return self.quote_name(column)\n  ```\n\nThis fixes the issue where `CREATE INDEX` statements had `(\\\"name\\\"DESC)` instead of `(\\\"name\\\" DESC)`.\n\n### 2. **Fixed the `IndexColumns` class in `/testbed/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`** (lines 114-130):\n- Changed from using hardcoded format strings that always added spaces:\n  ```python\n  col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n  try:\n      col = '{} {}'.format(col, self.col_suffixes[idx])\n  except IndexError:\n      pass\n  ```\n- To using a parts list approach that only adds parts when they're not empty:\n  ```python\n  col_parts = [self.quote_name(column)]\n  opclass = self.opclasses[idx]\n  if opclass:\n      col_parts.append(opclass)\n  try:\n      suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n      if suffix:\n          col_parts.append(suffix)\n  except IndexError:\n      pass\n  return ' '.join(col_parts)\n  ```\n\nThis fixes the issue where indexes with opclasses but without explicit ordering produced `(\\\"name\\\" text_pattern_ops )` with a trailing space (now it produces `(\\\"name\\\" text_pattern_ops)` without the trailing space).\n\n## Verification:\n- All original DDL reference tests pass (28 tests)\n- All index-related tests pass (28 tests ran, 63 skipped for DB-specific reasons)\n- Created comprehensive tests that verify:\n  - Descending order indexes have proper spacing before DESC\n  - Opclass-only indexes have no trailing space\n  - Opclass indexes with descending order have proper formatting\n  - All edge cases are handled (empty opclasses, empty suffixes, multiple columns)\n- The exact examples from the PR description now work correctly!\n",

Here's what was fixed:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n1. **Fixed whitespace in CREATE INDEX statements for descending order** (in `/testbed/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`):\n   - Updated the `Columns.__str__()` method to add a space before suffixes like \"DESC\" only when they're not empty\n   - This ensures we get `\"name\" DESC` instead of `\"name\"DESC`\n\n2. **Fixed trailing space issue with opclasses in CREATE INDEX statements**:\n   - Updated the `IndexColumns.__str__()` method to use a more robust approach that only adds parts when they contain values\n   - Now when an index has an opclass but no explicit ordering, we get `\"name\" text_pattern_ops` instead of `\"name\" text_pattern_ops ` (with trailing space)\n   - The fix properly handles all combinations: opclass only, opclass with DESC, empty opclasses, multiple columns with mixed configurations\n\n## Verification:\n- All existing tests pass (DDL references tests and index tests)\n- Created comprehensive tests to verify the specific issues mentioned in the PR\n- The exact examples from the PR now work as expected:\n  - Index with `-name` correctly produces `\"name\" DESC`\n  - Index with opclass without ordering correctly produces `\"name\" text_pattern_ops` (no trailing space)\n  - Index with opclass and descending ordering correctly produces `\"name\" text_pattern_ops DESC`\n\nThe fixes are minimal, focused, and maintain backward compatibility while solving both whitespace issues mentioned in the PR description.",
