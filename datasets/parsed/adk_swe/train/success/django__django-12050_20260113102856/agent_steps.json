Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nQuery.resolve_lookup_value coerces value of type list to tuple\nDescription\n\t\nChanges introduced in #30687 cause an input value list to be coerced to tuple breaking exact value queries. This affects ORM field types that are dependent on matching input types such as PickledField.\nThe expected iterable return type should match input iterable type.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "Perfect! I've successfully implemented the fix for the issue. Let me summarize what was done:\n\n## Summary of the fix:\n\n**Issue**: In `Query.resolve_lookup_value`, when resolving lookup values that are lists, they were being coercively converted to tuples. This broke ORM field types that are dependent on matching input types such as PickledField, since lists and tuples produce different pickles but would be treated the same way during querying (leading to not finding matching records).\n\n**Fix**: Modified the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `/testbed/django/db/models/sql/query.py` to preserve the input iterable type (list remains list, tuple remains tuple) instead of always converting everything to a tuple.\n\n**Changes made**:\n1. Modified lines 1076-1080 in `Query.resolve_lookup_value`:\n   - Check if original value was a list or tuple\n   - Return a list when original was a list, tuple when original was a tuple\n   - Maintain all existing functionality for resolving expressions within the iterable\n\n**Verification**:\n- Created tests to verify lists are no longer coerced to tuples\n- Verified tuples still work correctly\n- Tested edge cases including empty iterables, nested iterables, mixed iterables with expressions\n- Demonstrated why this fix is important for type-sensitive fields like PickledField\n- Ran existing Django tests to ensure no regression\n\nThe fix is minimal and focused - it only changes the specific behavior mentioned in the issue description while maintaining backward compatibility for all other use cases.\n\n",

This affects ORM field types that are dependent on matching input types such as PickledField.\nThe expected iterable return type should match input iterable type.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"
