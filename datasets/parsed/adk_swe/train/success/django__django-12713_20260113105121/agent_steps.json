      "output": "Great! The task is complete. Let me summarize what was done:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the fix for the issue \"Allow overriding widget in formfield_for_manytomany()\" \n\n### The Problem:\n- When users tried to set a widget parameter in the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method, it didn't work - the widget would get overwritten by Django's default widgets (like FilteredSelectMultiple, AutocompleteSelectMultiple, etc.) regardless of what was passed in kwargs.\n- This behavior was inconsistent with `formfield_for_foreignkey()` which properly respects custom widgets passed in kwargs.\n\n### The Fix:\nMade a minimal change to `/testbed/django/contrib/admin/options.py` (around line 253):\n- Wrapped the widget selection logic in `formfield_for_manytomany()` with `if 'widget' not in kwargs:` check\n- This ensures that only when no custom widget is specified does Django apply its default widget logic\n\n### What was changed:\n```python\n# Before:\nautocomplete_fields = self.get_autocomplete_fields(request)\nif db_field.name in autocomplete_fields:\n    kwargs['widget'] = AutocompleteSelectMultiple(db_field.remote_field, self.admin_site, using=db)\nelif db_field.name in self.raw_id_fields:\n    kwargs['widget'] = widgets.ManyToManyRawIdWidget(db_field.remote_field, self.admin_site, using=db)\nelif db_field.name in [*self.filter_vertical, *self.filter_horizontal]:\n    kwargs['widget'] = widgets.FilteredSelectMultiple(\n        db_field.verbose_name,\n        db_field.name in self.filter_vertical\n    )\n\n# After:\nautocomplete_fields = self.get_autocomplete_fields(request)\nif 'widget' not in kwargs:\n    if db_field.name in autocomplete_fields:\n        kwargs['widget'] = AutocompleteSelectMultiple(db_field.remote_field, self.admin_site, using=db)\n    elif db_field.name in self.raw_id_fields:\n        kwargs['widget'] = widgets.ManyToManyRawIdWidget(db_field.remote_field, self.admin_site, using=db)\n    elif db_field.name in [*self.filter_vertical, *self.filter_horizontal]:\n        kwargs['widget'] = widgets.FilteredSelectMultiple(\n            db_field.verbose_name,\n            db_field.name in self.filter_vertical\n        )\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- Created test scripts that demonstrate the issue was fixed\n- Verified all edge cases work correctly\n- Ran existing admin tests and widget tests - all pass successfully\n- The behavior now matches `formfield_for_foreignkey()` exactly as requested",
