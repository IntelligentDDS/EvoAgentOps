This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "## Summary of Changes\n\nI've fixed the misleading exception message when required columns are missing from a TimeSeries object. The changes were made to `/testbed/astropy/timeseries/core.py` in the `_check_required_columns` method.\n\n### The Problem\nWhen users tried to remove a required column (other than 'time'), they would get a confusing error message like:\n```\nValueError: TimeSeries object is invalid - expected 'time' as the first columns but found 'time'\n```\nThis happened because the validation was only checking if the first few columns matched the required columns in order, without first checking if required columns were actually missing.\n\n### The Solution\nI enhanced the validation logic to:\n1. **First check if any required columns are actually missing** - if so, raise an explicit error message listing the missing columns\n2. **Only check column order if all required columns are present** - this provides a more appropriate error message about column ordering issues\n\n### Key Changes:\n- Added missing columns detection: iterates through all required columns and checks if each is present in the table\n- Improved error messages:\n  - For missing columns: `TimeSeries object is invalid - missing required column: 'flux'` (or `columns: 'flux', 'error'` for multiple missing)\n  - For wrong column order: clear message showing expected vs actual columns\n- Maintained backwards compatibility: kept the original error message format for single required column (like just 'time')\n- Preserved relaxed mode behavior: no errors are raised when in relaxed mode (empty/partially built TimeSeries objects)\n\n### Testing\nThe fix handles all cases correctly:\n- ✓ Original issue case: removing a required column (like 'flux') now shows correct error about missing column\n- ✓ Removing 'time' column: maintains original behavior for backwards compatibility\n- ✓ Multiple required columns missing: lists all missing columns\n- ✓ Wrong column order: clear error showing expected vs actual column order\n- ✓ Relaxed mode: still works for building TimeSeries objects incrementally",
