The ``run_from_argv()`` method calls ``create_parser()`` to get\n   166\t       an ``ArgumentParser`` for the arguments, parses them, performs\n   167\t       any environment changes requested by options like\n   168\t       ``pythonpath``, and then calls the ``execute()`` method,\n   169\t       passing the parsed arguments.\n   170\t\n   171\t    3. The ``execute()`` method attempts to carry out the command by\n   172\t       calling the ``handle()`` method with the parsed arguments; any\n   173\t       output produced by ``handle()`` will be printed to standard\n   174\t       output and, if the command is intended to produce a block of\n   175\t       SQL statements, will be wrapped in ``BEGIN`` and ``COMMIT``.\n   176\t\n   177\t    4. If ``handle()`` or ``execute()`` raised any exception (e.g.\n   178\t       ``CommandError``), ``run_from_argv()`` will  instead print an error\n   179\t       message to ``stderr``.\n   180\t\n   181\t    Thus, the ``handle()`` method is typically the starting point for\n   182\t    subclasses; many built-in commands and command types either place\n   183\t    all of their logic in ``handle()``, or perform some additional\n   184\t    parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from it to more\n   185\t    specialized methods as needed.\n   186\t\n   187\t    Several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way:\n   188\t\n   189\t    ``help``\n   190\t        A short description of the command, which will be printed in\n   191\t        help messages.\n   192\t\n   193\t    ``output_transaction``\n   194\t        A boolean indicating whether the command outputs SQL\n   195\t        statements; if ``True``, the output will automatically be\n   196\t        wrapped with ``BEGIN;`` and ``COMMIT;``.

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAdd --skip-checks option to management commands.\nDescription\n\t\nManagement commands already have skip_checks stealth option. I propose exposing this option on the command line. This would allow users to skip checks when running a command from the command line. Sometimes in a development environment, it is nice to move ahead with a task at hand rather than getting side tracked fixing a system check.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3.

      "output": "## Summary\n\nI have successfully implemented the `--skip-checks` option for management commands as requested in the PR description. Here are the changes made:\n\n### Changes:\n\n1. **Added `--skip-checks` option to base command parser** in `/testbed/django/core/management/base.py`:\n   - Added the argument definition in the `create_parser()` method\n   - The option appears in help text with description: \"Skip system checks prior to executing the command.\"\n   - This makes the option available to ALL management commands that inherit from BaseCommand\n\n2. **Fixed the call_command API** in `/testbed/django/core/management/__init__.py`:\n   - Updated the logic to only default to `skip_checks=True` when running programmatically, but not when the option was already provided via command line arguments\n   - This prevents overriding the command line option when it's explicitly specified\n\n### Features:\n- Users can now skip system checks from command line with `--skip-checks` argument\n- This helps developers work on their tasks without being blocked by system checks\n- The option is hidden in stealth mode when calling commands programmatically (maintains backward compatibility)\n- Only system checks are skipped; migrations checks still run when `--skip-checks` is used (as implemented in the original code)\n\n### Test results:\n- ✅ **All management commands** now have the `--skip-checks` option available\n- ✅ **Command line usage**: `manage.py command --skip-checks` bypasses system checks\n- ✅ **Programmatic usage**: `call_command()` still defaults to skip_checks=True when not specified\n- ✅ **Help text**: The option is properly documented in command help\n- ✅ **Edge cases**: Works with commands that require system checks, respects requires_migrations_checks flag, no conflicts with existing options\n\nThe implementation is minimal, follows Django's patterns, maintains backward compatibility, and exactly addresses the requirements specified in the PR description.",
