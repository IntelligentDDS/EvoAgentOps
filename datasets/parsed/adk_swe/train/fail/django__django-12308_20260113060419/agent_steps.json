I added a special case in `display_for_field` (in `/testbed/django/contrib/admin/utils.py`) that detects when the field is a JSONField and handles it specially:\n   - Added `import json` at the top of the file\n   - Added a new condition `elif isinstance(field, models.JSONField):`\n   - Inside this condition, we handle the value the same way the JSONField form field's prepare_value method does:\n     - If it's an `InvalidJSONInput`, we return it as-is\n     - Otherwise, we serialize it to proper JSON using `json.dumps()` and respecting the field's custom encoder if it has one\n\n3. I extensively tested the fix:\n   - The main issue is fixed: dicts are now displayed as valid JSON with double quotes\n   - InvalidJSONInput is properly passed through unchanged\n   - Custom encoders are respected\n   - All edge cases work correctly (empty dicts, lists, nested structures, primitive types, None values)\n   - All existing field types still work as they did before\n   - PostgreSQL JSONField (which inherits from the built-in JSONField) will also be handled correctly\n\nThe fix is minimal and focused - it only adds the JSONField handling where needed, without modifying any other behavior, and it follows the recommendation in the PR description to handle the InvalidJSONInput case properly.\n\n",

      "output": "## Summary\n\nI have successfully implemented the fix for the JSONField display issue in Django admin when the field is readonly. Here's what was done:\n\n### Changes made:\n\n1. **Modified `/testbed/django/contrib/admin/utils.py`**:\n   - Added `import json` to the top of the file\n   - Added a special case in `display_for_field` function to handle JSONField:\n     ```python\n     elif isinstance(field, models.JSONField):\n         # Handle JSONField values properly - use the same logic as JSONField.prepare_value\n         from django.forms.fields import InvalidJSONInput\n         if isinstance(value, InvalidJSONInput):\n             return value\n         return json.dumps(value, cls=field.encoder)\n     ```\n\n### What the fix does:\n- **Fixes the main issue**: JSONField values (like `{\"foo\": \"bar\"}`) were being displayed as `{'foo': 'bar'}` with single quotes (not valid JSON) when readonly. Now they're displayed as proper JSON with double quotes.\n- **Handles InvalidJSONInput case**: If the field contains invalid JSON that couldn't be parsed (represented as `InvalidJSONInput` object), it's displayed as-is instead of trying to reserialize it.\n- **Respects custom encoders**: If a JSONField was defined with a custom encoder, it will be used when serializing the value.\n- **Maintains backward compatibility**: All other field types still work exactly as they did before.\n- **Supports PostgreSQL JSONField**: Since the PostgreSQL JSONField (from `django.contrib.postgres.fields`) inherits from the built-in JSONField, it also gets the fix automatically.\n\n### Verification:\n- Created comprehensive tests showing the issue is fixed\n- Tested edge cases including nested structures, lists, primitive types, None values, and invalid JSON\n- Verified all existing fields continue to work correctly\n- Confirmed PostgreSQL JSONField would also be handled properly through inheritance\n\nThe implementation is minimal, focused, and follows the recommendation in the PR description.",
