When parent is optional, `require_all_fields=True`, and we provide only one field, it's returning valid when it should be invalid.\n\nWait, let me debug this. When we have `user_0 = 'john'` and `user_1 = ''`:\n- `value` would be ['john', '']\n- `all_empty` would be `False` (because 'john' is not empty)\n- So it skips the early return and goes into the loop\n\nWait in the loop for the second field (EmailField):\n```python\nfield_value = ''\nif field_value in self.empty_values:\n    if self.require_all_fields:\n        # Raise a 'required' error if the MultiValueField is\n        # required and any field is empty.\n        if self.required:\n            raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['required'], code='required')\n```\n\nAh! The problem is when `self.require_all_fields=True` but `self.required=False`, it doesn't validate that all fields are filled! The comment says \"Raise a 'required' error if the MultiValueField is required and any field is empty.\"\n\nWait that's not correct. When `require_all_fields=True`, it should require all fields to be filled regardless of whether the parent field is required or not?\n\nLet me check what `require_all_fields` is supposed to do. Looking at the docstring:\n</think_never_used_51bce0c785ca2f68081bfa7d91973934>\nI see the issue! Looking at the code for require_all_fields:\n\n```python\nif field_value in self.empty_values:\n    if self.require_all_fields:\n        # Raise a 'required' error if the MultiValueField is\n        # required and any field is empty.\n        if self.required:\n            raise ValidationError(self.error_messages['required'], code='required')\n```\n\nThe logic only raises an error when `self.require_all_fields=True` AND `self.required=True`. But actually, `require_all_fields=True` should mean \"all fields must be filled, even if the parent field is not required but some data is provided\".\n\nWait let me check what the actual intended behavior is by looking at the docstring or original code comments:\n\n",

All the original issue tests pass correctly now. \n\nLet me summarize what we've done:\n1. **Identified the bug**: When all sub-fields are empty in a MultiValueField with `required=False` but some sub-fields have `required=True`, the validation was skipped entirely due to an early return in the clean() method.\n\n2. **Fixed the bug**: Modified the early return logic to only return early if:\n   - All values are empty AND\n   - Parent field is not required AND\n   - `require_all_fields=True` OR there are no required sub-fields\n\n3. **Thoroughly tested the fix**:\n   - Original issue test cases all pass correctly\n   - Edge cases handled correctly (None values, empty lists, various combinations)\n   - Backward compatibility maintained for require_all_fields behavior\n   - Existing patterns still work correctly\n\nThe fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue without changing the behavior for other cases.\n\nLet me just check if there's anything else we should do to ensure this is clean:\n</think_never_used_51bce0c785ca2f68081bfa7d91973934>\nExcellent!

I've successfully fixed the issue described in the PR. Here's a summary:\n\n## Summary of the Fix\n\n**Problem**: MultiValueField was ignoring `required=True` values on sub-fields when all sub-fields were empty and the parent MultiValueField had `required=False`.\n\n**Root Cause**: In the `clean()` method, when all values were empty and the parent field was not required, it would return early without validating individual sub-fields:\n```python\n# Original problematic code\nif not value or not [v for v in value if v not in self.empty_values]:\n    if self.required:\n        raise ValidationError(...)\n    else:\n        return self.compress([])  # Early return skips sub-field validation!\n```\n\n**Solution**: Modified the logic to check if there are any required sub-fields before returning early:\n- If all values are empty but there are required sub-fields, it falls through to validate each field\n- Only returns early if there are no required sub-fields or if `require_all_fields=True`\n\n**Changes made in `/testbed/django/forms/fields.py`**:\n1. Updated the early return logic to check for required sub-fields\n2. Fixed an edge case bug that could cause an AttributeError when value is None\n3. Maintained full backward compatibility with existing behavior\n\n**Verification**:\n- The original issue is now fixed - when all sub-fields are empty but some are required, `form.is_valid()` correctly returns `False`\n- All existing behavior remains intact\n- Multiple edge cases are handled correctly: None values, empty lists, partial data, etc.\n- All tests pass successfully\n\nThe fix is minimal, focused, and addresses exactly what was described in the issue while maintaining compatibility with existing code.\n\n",
