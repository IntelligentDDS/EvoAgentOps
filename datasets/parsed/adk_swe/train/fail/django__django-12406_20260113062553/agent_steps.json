Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nModelForm RadioSelect widget for foreign keys should not present a blank option if blank=False on the model\nDescription\n\t\nUnlike the select widget, where a blank option is idiomatic even for required fields, radioselect has an inherent unfilled state that makes the \"-------\" option look suspiciously like a valid choice.\nclass TestRun(models.Model):\n\tdata_file = models.ForeignKey(BatchData, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=False)\nclass TestRunForm(ModelForm):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = TestRun\n\t\tfields = ['data_file']\n\t\twidgets = {'data_file': RadioSelect()}\nrenders {{test_run_form.data_file}} as\n<ul id=\"id_data_file\">\n <li><label for=\"id_data_file_0\">\n\t<input checked=\"checked\" id=\"id_data_file_0\" name=\"data_file\" type=\"radio\" value=\"\"> ---------\n </label></li>\n <li><label for=\"id_data_file_1\">\n\t<input id=\"id_data_file_1\" name=\"data_file\" type=\"radio\" value=\"1\"> First Data File\n </label></li>\n</ul>\nInstead, there should be no checked option for RadioSelect's <input> tags when rendering a new form from a model if blank is not a valid selection.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nModelForm RadioSelect widget for foreign keys should not present a blank option if blank=False on the model\nDescription\n\t\nUnlike the select widget, where a blank option is idiomatic even for required fields, radioselect has an inherent unfilled state that makes the \"-------\" option look suspiciously like a valid choice.\nclass TestRun(models.Model):\n\tdata_file = models.ForeignKey(BatchData, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=False)\nclass TestRunForm(ModelForm):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = TestRun\n\t\tfields = ['data_file']\n\t\twidgets = {'data_file': RadioSelect()}\nrenders {{test_run_form.data_file}} as\n<ul id=\"id_data_file\">\n <li><label for=\"id_data_file_0\">\n\t<input checked=\"checked\" id=\"id_data_file_0\" name=\"data_file\" type=\"radio\" value=\"\"> ---------\n </label></li>\n <li><label for=\"id_data_file_1\">\n\t<input id=\"id_data_file_1\" name=\"data_file\" type=\"radio\" value=\"1\"> First Data File\n </label></li>\n</ul>\nInstead, there should be no checked option for RadioSelect's <input> tags when rendering a new form from a model if blank is not a valid selection.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "Perfect! I've successfully implemented the fix for this issue. \n\n## Summary of changes:\n\nThe issue was that when using `RadioSelect` widget for a foreign key field that has `blank=False` (required field), Django was still rendering a blank \"---------\" option that was checked by default. This looked odd for radio select inputs and didn't make sense for required fields.\n\nThe fix was implemented in `/testbed/django/forms/models.py` in the `ModelChoiceField.__init__()` method. I added logic to detect when:\n1. The field is required (`required=True`) \n2. The widget used is `RadioSelect` (or any subclass, either as an instance or a class reference)\n\nIn these cases, we set `empty_label=None`, which prevents the blank option from being added in the `ModelChoiceIterator`.\n\n## Verified behavior:\n1. **RadioSelect with required foreign key**: No blank option is rendered, no radio is checked by default, required attribute is present on inputs, form validation works correctly\n2. **Regular Select with required foreign key**: Still works as before with the blank option\n3. **RadioSelect with optional (blank=True) foreign key**: Still shows blank option as expected\n4. **Custom RadioSelect subclasses**: Work correctly with the same behavior\n5. **Form validation**: Still properly enforces required field - submitting without selecting a radio shows the proper error\n\nThe implementation handles all edge cases and maintains backwards compatibility while solving the specific issue described in the PR.",
