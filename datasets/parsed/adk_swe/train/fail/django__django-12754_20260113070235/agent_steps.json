Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nFieldError when migrating field to new model subclass.\nDescription\n\t\nAnalogous to #21890. If creating a model subclass and moving a field onto it in the same step, makemigrations works but migrate dies with django.core.exceptions.FieldError: Local field 'title' in class 'Book' clashes with field of the same name from base class 'Readable'.\nFor example, take this model:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Readable(models.Model):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=200)\nAnd change to this:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Readable(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Book(Readable):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=200)\nThe migration generates with CreateModel for Book, then RemoveField for Readable.title. But running it produces the error.\nReversing the order of the migration operations makes it pass. The auto-detector should be able to use this order.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nFieldError when migrating field to new model subclass.\nDescription\n\t\nAnalogous to #21890. If creating a model subclass and moving a field onto it in the same step, makemigrations works but migrate dies with django.core.exceptions.FieldError: Local field 'title' in class 'Book' clashes with field of the same name from base class 'Readable'.\nFor example, take this model:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Readable(models.Model):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=200)\nAnd change to this:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Readable(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Book(Readable):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=200)\nThe migration generates with CreateModel for Book, then RemoveField for Readable.title. But running it produces the error.\nReversing the order of the migration operations makes it pass. The auto-detector should be able to use this order.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "## Summary of the fix:\n\nI've successfully implemented a fix for the issue described in the PR!\n\n**Problem:** When moving a field from a parent model to a model subclass in the same migration (i.e., creating a new subclass and moving a field from parent to it simultaneously), `makemigrations` generates a migration with:\n1. First `CreateModel` for the subclass\n2. Then `RemoveField` for the parent\n\nBut running this migration causes a `FieldError` because when creating the subclass, it inherits the field from the parent class that still exists, so when it tries to add its own local field with the same name, it conflicts.\n\n**Solution:** I modified the `check_dependency` method in `/testbed/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` to detect this case and create an implicit dependency between the `CreateModel` operation and the `RemoveField` operation. This makes the topological sort order swap them around, so we:\n1. First `RemoveField` from the parent\n2. Then `CreateModel` for the subclass\n\nThis way, when creating the subclass, the parent no longer has the field, so there's no conflict when adding the local field with the same name to the subclass.\n\n**Key changes:**\n1. Added special handling in the \"Removed field\" dependency case to check if we're creating a model that:\n   - Subclasses the model we're removing the field from\n   - Defines its own local field with the exact same name\n   \n2. If both conditions are met, it creates a dependency meaning \"this CreateModel must run after this RemoveField\".\n\n**Testing:**\n- The fix handles the exact case described in the PR\n- It doesn't affect normal migrations with unrelated operations\n- It correctly handles multiple fields moved at once\n- It correctly ignores non-subclass models with same field names\n- It doesn't create unwanted dependencies for multi-level inheritance\n- It maintains backwards compatibility for all other migration operations\n\nThe fix is minimal and targeted, only affecting the specific problematic case without breaking any other migration behavior.",
