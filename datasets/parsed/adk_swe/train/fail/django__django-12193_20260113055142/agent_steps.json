This is caused by the CheckboxInput widget's get_context() modifying the attrs dict passed into it. This is the only widget that modifies the attrs dict passed into its get_context().\nCheckboxInput setting attrs['checked'] to True: ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/widgets.py#L527\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Passes this copy to each widget's `get_context()` method\n\nThis ensures that if any widget modifies the attrs dict (like CheckboxInput does by adding 'checked': True), it only modifies its own copy, not the shared dict that's used for all widgets.\n\nLet me also check if there's any possibility of performance issues, but since we're just copying dictionaries which are typically small (just a few attributes like id, class, etc.), this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nLet me create one more test to verify that other types of widgets still work correctly with SplitArrayWidget:\n\n",

      "output": "Perfect! The bug is completely fixed. \n\n## Summary of what was done:\n\n1. **Identified the issue**: The `SplitArrayWidget.get_context()` method was reusing the same `final_attrs` dictionary for all widgets in the loop. When `CheckboxInput.get_context()` modified this dictionary in place by adding `'checked': True`, all subsequent widgets received the already modified dict.\n\n2. **Implemented the fix**: Modified the `SplitArrayWidget.get_context()` method to create a copy of `final_attrs` for each widget iteration using `.copy()`. This ensures that any modifications made by widgets like CheckboxInput only affect their own attribute dictionary, not the one shared across all widgets.\n\n3. **Tested thoroughly**:\n   - The main bug scenario (first checkbox True, others False) now works correctly ✓\n   - Mixed patterns of True/False now work correctly ✓\n   - All False/All True scenarios work correctly ✓\n   - Empty values work correctly ✓\n   - ID handling still works correctly ✓\n   - Other types of widgets (TextInput, PasswordInput, NumberInput) still work correctly ✓\n\n4. **The fix is minimal**: Only changed the necessary lines in the loop to create a copy of attrs for each widget, following similar patterns found in other widgets like MultiWidget (which copies attrs when ids are needed).\n\nThis fix ensures that when using a SplitArrayField with BooleanField (CheckboxInput widgets), the checkboxes will correctly reflect their actual data values, rather than all checkboxes being checked after the first True value appears in the array.\n\n",

Here's what was done:\n\n### The Problem\nWhen using `SplitArrayField` with `BooleanField`, after the first `True` value in the initial data array, all subsequent checkboxes would be displayed as checked, even if their actual values were `False`. This was caused by the `CheckboxInput` widget modifying the attributes dictionary in place when setting the `checked: True` attribute, and `SplitArrayWidget` reusing this same dictionary for all widgets.\n\n### The Solution\nModified `/testbed/django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py` in the `SplitArrayWidget.get_context()` method:\n1. Created a copy of `final_attrs` for each widget iteration using `.copy()`\n2. Modified this copy instead of the original dictionary when adding the dynamic id\n3. Passed this isolated copy to each widget's `get_context()` method\n\nThis ensures that any widget that modifies attributes in place will only affect its own copy, preventing cross-contamination between widgets.\n\n### Verification\nThe fix has been thoroughly tested:\n- ✅ First checkbox checked, others unchecked - works correctly\n- ✅ Mixed True/False patterns (True, False, True) - works correctly\n- ✅ All checkboxes unchecked - works correctly  \n- ✅ All checkboxes checked - works correctly\n- ✅ Empty values - works correctly\n- ✅ ID attribute handling - works correctly\n- ✅ Other widget types (TextInput, NumberInput, PasswordInput) are unaffected\n- ✅ The exact bug scenario from the PR description is now fixed\n\nThe fix is minimal, focused, and follows existing patterns in similar widgets like `MultiWidget`.",
