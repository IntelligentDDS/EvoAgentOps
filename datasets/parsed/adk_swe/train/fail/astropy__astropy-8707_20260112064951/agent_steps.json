Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nHeader.fromstring does not accept Python 3 bytes\nAccording to [the docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/_modules/astropy/io/fits/header.html#Header.fromstring), the method `Header.fromstring` \"...creates an HDU header from a byte string containing the entire header data.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"byte string\" here it really means the `str` type which on Python 2 could be raw binary data, but on Python 3 explicitly is not.   In fact it does work on Python 3's unicode `str`s, but here it assumes that the data can be ASCII-encoded.\r\n\r\nIts counterpart, `Header.fromfile` will work with files opened in text or binary mode.  So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

          "content": "\n<uploaded_files>\n/testbed\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /testbed (not in /tmp/inputs). Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nHeader.fromstring does not accept Python 3 bytes\nAccording to [the docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/_modules/astropy/io/fits/header.html#Header.fromstring), the method `Header.fromstring` \"...creates an HDU header from a byte string containing the entire header data.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"byte string\" here it really means the `str` type which on Python 2 could be raw binary data, but on Python 3 explicitly is not.   In fact it does work on Python 3's unicode `str`s, but here it assumes that the data can be ASCII-encoded.\r\n\r\nIts counterpart, `Header.fromfile` will work with files opened in text or binary mode.  So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nHeader.fromstring does not accept Python 3 bytes\nAccording to [the docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/_modules/astropy/io/fits/header.html#Header.fromstring), the method `Header.fromstring` \"...creates an HDU header from a byte string containing the entire header data.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"byte string\" here it really means the `str` type which on Python 2 could be raw binary data, but on Python 3 explicitly is not.   In fact it does work on Python 3's unicode `str`s, but here it assumes that the data can be ASCII-encoded.\r\n\r\nIts counterpart, `Header.fromfile` will work with files opened in text or binary mode.  So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

In fact it does work on Python 3's unicode `str`s, but here it assumes that the data can be ASCII-encoded.\r\n\r\nIts counterpart, `Header.fromfile` will work with files opened in text or binary mode.  So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

In fact it does work on Python 3's unicode `str`s, but here it assumes that the data can be ASCII-encoded.\r\n\r\nIts counterpart, `Header.fromfile` will work with files opened in text or binary mode.  So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met.

      "output": "## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the required changes to make `Header.fromstring` and `Card.fromstring` accept Python 3 bytes objects in addition to strings, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing string usage.\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **Modified `/testbed/astropy/io/fits/header.py`**:\n   - Updated `Header.fromstring()` method to handle both `str` and `bytes` inputs by decoding bytes to ASCII using the existing `decode_ascii()` utility function\n   - Updated docstring to reflect the new parameter type (now \"str or bytes\")\n   - Added handling for non-ASCII bytes with automatic warning and replacement (using the existing functionality in `decode_ascii`)\n\n2. **Modified `/testbed/astropy/io/fits/card.py`**:\n   - Updated `Card.fromstring()` method to handle both `str` and `bytes` inputs, also using `decode_ascii()`\n   - Updated docstring to document the new parameter type\n   - Added an internal import of `decode_ascii()` since card.py doesn't import it by default\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Backward Compatible**: All existing string-based usage remains unchanged\n- **Proper ASCII Handling**: Bytes are decoded as ASCII, with proper warning and character replacement for non-ASCII bytes\n- **Same Interface**: The API remains exactly the same - users don't need to change any code, they can just pass bytes instead of strings\n- **Handles both cases**: Works with both human-readable header strings with newlines and raw 80-byte FITS card images without separators\n\nThe implementation is minimal, follows the existing patterns in the codebase (especially those in `Header.fromfile()` which already handles both binary and text files), and satisfies all requirements specified in the PR description.",
