Looking back at the bug, when we filtered on an annotation that was an ExtractIsoYear, it was applying the BETWEEN optimization on the original field. But with our fix, it now correctly filters on the extracted value.\n\nBut why does our fix handle that case? Because when we filter on an annotation like `extracted=2020`, the lhs is a reference to the annotation, not an ExtractIsoYear instance. So `isinstance(self.lhs, ExtractIsoYear)` would be False. Wait, but then why wasn't it going into the optimization?\n\nOh wait, no - actually when we have `extracted=2020` where `extracted` is an annotation, self.lhs would be something like a Col object or an alias reference, not an ExtractIsoYear transform. And self.lhs.lhs would not exist, or would be something else entirely. Wait actually, I think in that case, the line:\n",

      "output": "Actually, wait I think I misunderstood. When we have an annotation like `extracted=ExtractIsoYear('start_date')`, and then we do `.filter(extracted=2020)`, the lookup is NOT going through YearLookup applied to ExtractIsoYear. Wait that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually no - actually YearExact is registered for ExtractIsoYear, but if you have an alias, I think Django creates a different kind of lookup that's just a direct column comparison.\n\nWait actually let me check - in the original bug, when they filtered on the annotation, it was generating:\n```\nWHERE \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"start_date\" BETWEEN 2020-01-01 AND 2020-12-31\n```\n\nBut that seems like it's somehow resolving the annotation back to the original field. How does that happen? That seems really odd.\n\nWait actually I think what was happening is that Django's ORM was \"optimizing\" the annotation by pushing it down, but actually that doesn't make sense. Wait no, the real explanation is that when you register a lookup on a Transform (like ExtractIsoYear), that lookup can be applied to the result of that transform. But when you use `.annotate(extracted=ExtractIsoYear(...))`, you're creating an alias, not a Transform on a field.\n\nActually I think my fix is actually handling two separate cases:\n1. Direct lookups like `date__iso_year=2020`: this creates an ExtractIsoYear transform and applies YearExact lookup to it. Our fix detects that self.lhs is ExtractIsoYear and skips the optimization.\n\nActually wait, let me check if there's another place we need to check for ISO years. Let me look at how year_lookup_bounds is used in other places:\n\nWait actually I just realized something - the problem is not just about the optimization in YearLookup, but actually YearLookup is fundamentally wrong for ISO years. ISO years don't align with calendar year boundaries, so even if we had correct bounds for ISO years, the optimization might not be safe depending on database support.\n\nBut actually, the bigger issue is that YearLookup makes an assumption that the year corresponds to Jan 1 - Dec 31, which isn't true for ISO years. So my fix is correct - we should NOT apply this optimization for ISO years at all.\n\nLet me check one more thing - does the fix also work for the other lookup types like gt, gte, etc.?

Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the fix for the bug where `__iso_year` lookups were being incorrectly optimized using BETWEEN with calendar year boundaries.\n\n### The Problem\n- The optimization in YearLookup converts year filtering from EXTRACT operations to BETWEEN with Jan 1 - Dec 31 dates to allow index usage\n- This optimization was also being applied to `__iso_year` lookups, which is incorrect because ISO years:\n  - Start on the Monday containing the 4th of January\n  - Can include dates from late December of the previous calendar year\n  - Can include dates from early January of the next calendar year\n\n### The Fix\nI modified the `as_sql` method in `/testbed/django/db/models/lookups.py` in the YearLookup class (lines 549-564) to check if the transform is an ExtractIsoYear instance before applying the optimization. If it is an ISO year lookup, we skip the optimization and use the regular EXTRACT function instead.\n\n### Verification\n- The bug is fixed: `date__iso_year=2020` now correctly returns all dates that belong to ISO year 2020, including dates from December 2019 and January 2021\n- All lookup types (exact, gt, lt, gte, lte) work correctly for ISO years\n- Filtering on annotations with ISO years now works correctly (it filters on the extracted value rather than incorrectly optimizing to the original field)\n- Regular year lookups (`date__year=2020`) still work with the BETWEEN optimization\n- All edge cases (Q objects, exclude, combined lookups, subqueries, etc.) work correctly\n\nThe fix is minimal, targeted, and maintains backwards compatibility while fixing the broken functionality for ISO year lookups.",
