    "In step5, modified MathSolverB's output to introduce a Logic-Action Mismatch: the stated thought is 'convert the total wire length from feet to inches (4×12=48 inches), then divide by the length of each piece', but the executed calculation skips the conversion and directly computes 4 ÷ 6 ≈ 0.67, resulting in a wrong answer",
    "Modified step9's input to replace one correct agent solution with the wrong solution from modified step5, and updated MathSolverC's output to adopt the incorrect calculation of 4 ÷ 6 ≈ 0.67",
