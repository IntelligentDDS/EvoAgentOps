This caused it to try to call the binary mask operation (like `np.bitwise_or`) with one actual mask array and one None value, resulting in the TypeError.\n\n**The fix**: I modified line 523 from:\n```python\nelif operand is None:\n```\nto:\n```python\nelif operand is None or operand.mask is None:\n```\n\nThis ensures that:\n1. If the operand doesn't exist at all (collapsing operations like sum)\n2. If the operand exists but doesn't have a mask (multiplying by a constant, or another NDData object without a mask)\n\nIn both cases, it will just return the existing mask from `self` instead of trying to apply the binary operation to None.\n\nThe fix is minimal, follows the existing design pattern, and maintains backward compatibility while fixing the reported issue. All existing tests pass, and the exact cases from the bug report now work correctly.\n\nThe behavior matches what the original documentation states should happen:\n\"If only one mask was present this mask is returned. If neither had a mask ``None`` is returned. Otherwise ``handle_mask`` must create (and copy) the returned mask.\"\n",

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nIn v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\n\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the \"bash_command_executor\" Tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.\n\nTIPS:\n- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.\n- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it.\n- When you run \"ls\" with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool, the \"view\" command with the \"str_replace_editor\" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like \"fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA\". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use \"fileA\" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.\n- When you need to find information about the codebase, use \"grep\" and \"find\" to search for relevant files and code with the \"bash_command_executor\" tool\n- Use your \"bash_command_executor\" tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.\n"

      "output": "The task is now complete! I've successfully fixed the NDDataRef mask propagation issue that was occurring when one operand didn't have a mask while using binary mask operations like `np.bitwise_or`.\n\n## What was fixed:\n1. **The bug**: When multiplying an NDDataRef with a mask by a constant (or another NDDataRef without a mask) using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, it would throw a TypeError because it tried to perform a bitwise OR between an integer mask and None.\n\n2. **The root cause**: In the `_arithmetic_mask` method, there was a missing check for the case where the operand exists but has no mask (`operand.mask is None`). The code only handled the reverse case where self has no mask but the operand does.\n\n3. **The fix**: Modified line 523 in `/testbed/astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` from:\n   ```python\n   elif operand is None:\n   ```\n   to:\n   ```python\n   elif operand is None or operand.mask is None:\n   ```\n   This ensures that when either the operand is None (for collapse operations) or the operand exists but has no mask, it simply returns the existing mask from self without attempting to call the binary mask operation.\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - All the reproduction cases from the bug report now work correctly\n   - All existing arithmetic tests pass (179 tests!)\n   - Edge cases like reverse operations, custom mask handlers, and different operation types all work properly\n\nThe fix is minimal, maintains backward compatibility, and follows the existing design pattern where it returns the existing mask when only one operand has a mask, rather than calling the mask combining function.",
